# Bachelor Degrees Women Hold in the U.S.

As a female computer science and statistics major, I have seen the absence of female portrayal in the classroom and within the industry. Due to this lack of representation, I wanted to analyze and visualize the percent of bachelor degrees women hold in computer science and STEM overall. 

I utilized a CSV provided by the United States Department of Education Statistics and leveraged pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 

You can see the python code above in the files along with the data sets.
