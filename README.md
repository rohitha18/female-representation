# Bachelor Degrees Women Hold in the U.S.

As a female computer science and statistics major, I have seen the absence of female portrayal in the classroom and within the industry. Due to this lack of representation, I wanted to analyze and visualize the percent of bachelor degrees women hold in computer science and STEM overall. 

I utilized a CSV provided by the United States Department of Education Statistics and leveraged pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 

You can see the python code above in the files along with the data sets.

# Nobel Prizes by Gender from 1901 to 2019  

To continue with the trend of female representation, I was curious to see the relation of Nobel Prizes won by women compared to men. Thus, I decided to employ pandas and Matplotlib to construct the pie chart below.
